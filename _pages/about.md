# About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Information Systems Department](https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/) at [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://www.umbc.edu/), advised by [Dr. James Foulds](http://jfoulds.informationsystems.umbc.edu/). I am also working as a research assistant in the [Foulds Research Group](http://jfoulds.informationsystems.umbc.edu/research_group.html) - The Latent Lab.    

I was an intern in the wavelet development team at [MathWorks Inc.](https://www.mathworks.com/), Natick, MA for Summer, 2019. Prior to joining UMBC as a graduate student, I worked in [Huawei Technologies (Bangladesh) Ltd.](https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information/) as a Core Network Engineer. Before that, I received my Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering at [University of Dhaka, Bangladesh](https://www.du.ac.bd/), supervised by Prof. [Zahid H. Mahmood](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gnu1OzUAAAAJ&hl=en).

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in the general area of artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML), particularly in the area of AI/ML Fairness and Ethics. It is now well understood that AI/ML systems, trained on data without due care, often exhibit unfair and discriminatory behavior against certain demographic groups. This phenomenon can have harmful consequences in a variety of AI-automated tasks including college admissions, financial and housing approvals, bail and sentencing decisions, job hiring, and the prioritization of healthcare services. My research is focused on building socially conscious statistical methods for modeling, measuring, and correcting unfairness or implicit bias in machine learning algorithms.
